# Extraction for IW4X

Earlier version of the new VIP Game mode. Original files were lost, this is a barebones VIP renamed in it's current state.

Uploading this to github to allow others to commit changes and turn it into a community effort

Current To do list:

Defending Team (VIP)
Add a defend Icon to the VIP
Give the VIP a mofidied loadout, Health, Weapon, Perks etc.
Add an Extraction point (HQ spawn locations?)
Capture Timer for Zone & Countdown till game win
Add a respawn timer to defenders who die. (Wave respawning)

Extraction Zone Stuff
Add a range for initial capture
Sentry Drops on capture for defending? 2-3
Helicopter fly in and hover over point to end game (Can just use care package helicopter possibly)

Attacking Team
Add a kill icon to the VIP
Add team lives to allow for an end game scenario to avoid rushing
Add a 2nd win conditiion for balance?


Any other ideas are welcome.
